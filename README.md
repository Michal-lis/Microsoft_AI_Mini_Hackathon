# Microsoft_AI_Mini_Hackathon
This is a simple bot playing Matching Cards game built using using the Microsoft Cognitive Services API (analyzed vision and optical character recognition) and built on a template provided by AI Gaming organisation. It is and individual project developed during Microsoft Mini AI hackathon organized by UCL Microsoft Student Partners at Microsoft Reactor London.

The bot is not very intelligent as during the tournament it went only through the first stage of playoffs, but the event was a good occasion to get some practice with Azure AI API and the way game bots work.
